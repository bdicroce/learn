[The Evolution of Kafka at ING Bank](https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-london18/the-evolution-of-kafka-at-ing-bank)

*At the New York Summit, Ferd Scheepers, Chief Information Architect for ING, took you on a journey during his keynote. In this new session we want to tell you more about this journey and how it relates to Kafka. It all started within ING when a solution was needed to improve our fraud detection system for online banking. The system was expensive, not resilient and hard to scale up to be able to process the ever growing amount of data needed for real-time fraud detection.*
